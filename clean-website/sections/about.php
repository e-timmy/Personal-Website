                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm [Your Name], a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my
                    [Bachelor’s/Master’s] degree at [Your University]. With a keen interest in
                    [software development/machine learning/cybersecurity], I have dedicated my academic
                    journey to understanding and innovating within this field. My coursework and projects
                    have not only provided me with a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving
                    but have also sparked my curiosity in [specific area of interest, like artificial
                    intelligence or data structures].</p>
                <p>Outside the classroom, I engage in coding competitions and contribute
                    to open source projects, which helps me stay sharp and current with industry trends.
                    I am particularly proud of my project [Project Name], which [briefly describe what
                    it does or its impact]. As I continue to build my technical skills, I am eager to
                    connect with like-minded peers and professionals in the tech community.
                    Feel free to reach out if you want to talk tech, collaborate on a project,
                    or just share ideas!</p>
